# WeatherAppV2

This is a weather app that retrieves current weather data using the Open Weather API. The app is designed to help users get accurate weather information for any city in the world. Additionally, the app features a pseudo autocomplete function which suggests potential cities as the user types. The autocomplete feature is still being developed at this time
